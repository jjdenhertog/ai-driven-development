Data means any sort of source/footage material, it can be images, audio tracks, video clips, text strings, values for colors/positions, even dynamic animations using expressions. All of those things can be replaced for every job without even opening a project file or starting After Effects.(no content)This process can be called templated, data-driven or dynamic video generation. This approach allows you to create a .aep file once, and then reuse it for as many target results as you need to.\n\n### Installation\n\nYou can download binaries directly from the releases section, or install them using npm. However, the npm version of the binaries doesn't include all optional plugin packages. If you wish to install them as well, please do so by providing each one individually: npm i -g @nexrender/cli @nexrender/action-copy @nexrender/action-encode ...\n\n### Job Configuration\n\nA job is a single working unit in the nexrender ecosystem. It is a json document, that describes what should be done, and how it should be done.(no content)Footage item replacement is simple - you describe which asset will replace existing described footage item in a specific layer, by specifying src, and one of the layerName or layerIndex options.\n\n### Render Farm Implementation\n\nWhile nexrender is described as having \"farm\" capabilities, the documentation mentions \"farm\" capabilities for rendering a single project on multiple machines. However, the current implementation requires manual setup:\n\nTo render a single project on multiple machines, you need to do manual work: You will need to create your job and then copy it as many times as many workers you want to render your project simultaneously. Then you edit each one of them so that they would have job.settings.frameStart and job.settings.frameEnd set up.(no content)For example, if your total project is 10 minutes at 30 FPS with 4 workers, each part would render 2.5 minutes (4500 frames). You'd set up jobs like: 1st job: start: 0, finish: 4499; 2nd job: start: 4500, finish: 8999; 3rd job: start: 9000, finish: 13499; 4th job: start: 13500, finish: 17999.(no content)The process isn't the most straightforward at the moment. However, there are plans to automate most of it and roll it out as a feature later on.\n\n### Render Settings\n\nKey render settings include: skipRender (prevents actual rendering), multiFrames (enables After Effects' multi-frame rendering), multiFramesCPU (percentage of CPU for multi-frame rendering, 90% default), and reuse (reuses currently running After Effects instance if found).\n\n### Alternatives and Context\n\nNexrender is a tool for render automation for Adobe After Effects that also allows users to set up a render network and render several projects simultaneously.(no content)Nexrender is an open-source rendering automation tool designed specifically for After Effects. It enables you to automate the rendering process by utilizing a command-line interface (CLI) and a simple JSON-based configuration file. Nexrender allows you to set up rendering tasks, specify the project file, output destination, and various rendering options through the configuration file. This makes it convenient to define multiple rendering jobs and customize each job's parameters according to your requirements.(no content)It's pretty flexible and modular, so you can edit the workflow to your liking and create pretty much anything you want. The only downside is that it requires coding knowledge.\n\n### Network Rendering Context\n\nRender farming is when a network of computers is used together to render a single composition. You can set this up to work with render-only versions of After Effects called render engines. Render farming helps reduce the time a single machine takes to export a composition.(no content)You can use the aerender application to perform rendering operations on multiple computers as part of a render farm, or you can use the aerender application on a single computer as part of a batch operation. You use the program by entering the command aerender on the command line (or in a batch script), followed by a series of optional arguments."],"durationSeconds":56.039773875}},"inputData":"{\"session_id\":\"ada33ad5-e17f-4625-be0a-9279f6a6b9f4\",\"transcript_path\":\"/Users/jjdenhertog/.claude/projects/-Users-jjdenhertog-Projects-mig-afx-render-manager/ada33ad5-e17f-4625-be0a-9279f6a6b9f4.jsonl\",\"hook_event_name\":\"PostToolUse\",\"tool_name\":\"WebSearch\",\"tool_input\":{\"query\":\"nexrender distributed render farm After Effects documentation\"},\"tool_response\":{\"query\":\"nexrender distributed render farm After Effects documentation\",\"results\":[\"I'll search for documentation about nexrender distributed render farm for After Effects.\",{\"tool_use_id\":\"srvtoolu_012X28CmSPa4ukzeYzrFL6kr\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"In Depth: Render Farms / Network Rendering / Distributed Rendering\",\"url\":\"https://www.toolfarm.com/tutorial/in_depth_render_farms-2/\"},{\"title\":\"GitHub - inlife/nexrender: ðŸ“¹ Data-driven render automation for After Effects\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender\"},{\"title\":\"How to create an After Effects rendering bot in 2025\",\"url\":\"https://www.plainlyvideos.com/blog/after-effects-render-bot\"},{\"title\":\"Automated rendering and network rendering in After Effects\",\"url\":\"https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/automated-rendering-network-rendering.html\"},{\"title\":\"Nexrender - Automated video creation and editing\",\"url\":\"https://www.nexrender.com\"},{\"title\":\"Guide:Using a Render Farm | Adobe After Effects Wiki | Fandom\",\"url\":\"https://aftereffects.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:Using_a_Render_Farm\"},{\"title\":\"After Effects rendering farms detailed tests & comparasion\",\"url\":\"https://www.plainlyvideos.com/blog/after-effects-cloud-rendering\"},{\"title\":\"nexrender - Open Collective\",\"url\":\"https://opencollective.com/nexrender\"},{\"title\":\"Render Farm Â· Issue #191 Â· inlife/nexrender\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender/issues/191\"},{\"title\":\"After Effects Guide | GarageFarm.NET Render Farm\",\"url\":\"https://garagefarm.net/documentation/after-effects-guide\"}]},\"Based on the search results, here's comprehensive documentation about nexrender distributed render farm for After Effects:\\n\\n## Nexrender Overview\\n\\nNexrender is a simple, small, carefully designed application with the main goal of rendering automation for Adobe After Effects based rendering workflows.(no content)The information is targeted at people at least somewhat comfortable with scripting or development, and who have basic knowledge of javascript language and json formats.\\n\\n### Key Features\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of using nexrender is an ability to render projects using data other than what has been used while the project has been created.

Technically speaking, its a very tiny HTTP server with minimal REST API support.\n   - Server acts as a single entry point for all your worker nodes, as well as api clients.\n   - Server uses process memory to store current list of jobs, and persists them onto disk each time a new job added/updated/removed/etc.\n\n2. **nexrender-worker**\n   - A CLI application which is responsible mainly for actual job processing and rendering, communication with the nexrender-server, and serves mainly as a consumer in the nexrender network model.\n   - A CLI application which is responsible mainly for actual job processing and rendering, communication with the `nexrender-server`, and serves mainly as a consumer in the nexrender network model.\n\n3. **nexrender-api**\n   - By using the nexrender API, you can automate the process of submitting jobs to nexrender, which can save you time and reduce the risk of errors.\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nThe server exposes a REST API with the following endpoints:\n\n- Gets list of all jobs, returns an array of json records.\n- Gets info about a specific job.\n- Creates a new job from json passed within a body. Requires content-type=application/json header to be present.\n- Updates an existing job, merges json provided by user with the one that exists in the server memory. Requires content-type=application/json header to be present.\n- Removes provided job from the server.\n- An internal method, used by worker to fetch a random job from the list, and start rendering. Probably should not be used by users, unless they know what are they doing.\n\n### Architecture Flow\n\nOverall, the client initiates requests to the server, the server manages the rendering process by assigning tasks to workers, and the API provides a programmatic interface for interacting with the server.\n\n### Project Structure\n\nProject has been devided onto multiple subprojects, and mutiple cli applications as a result. Every cli application is auto-compiled to a platform specific executable on publish and auto-uploaded to the releases section.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Distributed Rendering**: The architecture supports multiple workers connecting to a single server for distributed rendering\n2. **Job Queue Management**: The server maintains a job queue that workers can pick from\n3. **Authentication**: The third line of code sets the secret variable to the value 'myapisecret'. This is the API secret that clients will use to authenticate with the Nexrender server.\n4. **Tag-based Job Selection**: An internal method, used by worker to fetch a random job with specific tags from the list, and start rendering. Tags name must be an alphanumeric.\n5. **External Database Support**: Optional support for external databases can be added (like Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.), with some of them already in place.\n\n### Worker Configuration\n\nWorkers can be configured with various options including:\n- polling - number, amount of miliseconds to wait before checking queued projects from the api\n- tagSelector - string, (optional) provide the string tags (example primary,plugins,halowell : comma delimited) to pickup the job with specific tags. Leave it false to ignore and pick a random job from the server with no specific tags. Tags name must be an alphanumeric.\n- name - string. An unique name (or not) to the nexrender-worker, and it will be identified in the nexrender-server. It can be used as an executor name on picked job(s) as well.\n\nThis architecture enables scalable, distributed rendering workflows for After Effects projects with a clean separation between job management (server) and job execution (workers)."],"durationSeconds":46.49290787500001}},"inputData":"{\"session_id\":\"ada33ad5-e17f-4625-be0a-9279f6a6b9f4\",\"transcript_path\":\"/Users/jjdenhertog/.claude/projects/-Users-jjdenhertog-Projects-mig-afx-render-manager/ada33ad5-e17f-4625-be0a-9279f6a6b9f4.jsonl\",\"hook_event_name\":\"PostToolUse\",\"tool_name\":\"WebSearch\",\"tool_input\":{\"query\":\"nexrender github repository architecture server worker API\"},\"tool_response\":{\"query\":\"nexrender github repository architecture server worker API\",\"results\":[\"I'll search for information about the nexrender GitHub repository architecture, specifically focusing on its server-worker API structure.\",{\"tool_use_id\":\"srvtoolu_01KMSQDBLJEdttRvcKf2fnYi\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"GitHub - inlife/nexrender: ðŸ“¹ Data-driven render automation for After Effects\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender\"},{\"title\":\"Nexrender | NoSleepCreative Wiki\",\"url\":\"https://docs.nosleepcreative.com/dev/sandbox/nexrender\"},{\"title\":\"nexrender/server\",\"url\":\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nexrender/server\"},{\"title\":\"nexrender/worker\",\"url\":\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nexrender/worker\"},{\"title\":\"How to requeue a job if failed with Nexrender Server, Worker & API Â· inlife/nexrender Â· Discussion #766\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender/discussions/766\"},{\"title\":\"API server Â· inlife/nexrender Wiki\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender/wiki/API-server\"},{\"title\":\"Releases Â· inlife/nexrender\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender/releases\"},{\"title\":\"Nexrender - Automated video creation and editing\",\"url\":\"https://www.nexrender.com\"},{\"title\":\"stop a job when state is rendering job (nexrender-worker-nexrender-server) Â· Issue #885 Â· inlife/nexrender\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/inlife/nexrender/issues/885\"},{\"title\":\"nexrender Â· GitHub\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/nexrender\"}]},\"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about the nexrender GitHub repository architecture, particularly focusing on its server-worker API structure.\\n\\n## Nexrender Architecture Overview\\n\\nNexrender is a data-driven render automation tool for After Effects that uses a distributed architecture with the following key components:\\n\\n### Core Components\\n\\n1. **nexrender-server**\\n   - A CLI application which is responsible for job management, worker node cooperation, communications with the nexrender-worker instances, serves mainly as a producer in the nexrender network model.

It's a tool for data-driven render automation for After Effects that uses Adobe After Effects' aerender command-line interface application, creates a temporary folder, copies project and replaces assets with provided ones, uses AE's expressions, scripting, and compositing, stores projects in a local database managed from anywhere using http api, and renders project per machine and can be used to render several projects simultaneously.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can download binaries directly from the releases section, or install them using npm, whichever option works better for you.\n\n### NPM Installation\nHowever, please note: the npm version of the binaries doesn't include all optional plugin packages that are covered in the usage section. If you wish to install them as well, please do so by providing each one individually: npm i -g @nexrender/cli @nexrender/action-copy @nexrender/action-encode ...\n\n## Basic Setup Tutorial\n\n### 1. Simple Local Rendering\nWe will be using nexrender-cli binary for this example. It's recommended to download/install it if you haven't already.\n\n### 2. Understanding Jobs\nA job is a single working unit in the nexrender ecosystem. It is a json document, that describes what should be done, and how it should be done.\n\n### 3. Minimal Job Configuration\nMinimal job description always should contain a pointer onto Adobe After Effects project, which is needed to be rendered, and a composition that will be used to render. The pointer is src (string) field containing a URI pointing towards specified file, followed by composition (string) field, containing the name of the composition that needs to be rendered.\n\n## Job Configuration JSON Examples\n\n### Basic Job Example\n```json\n// myjob.json\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"src\": \"file:///users/myuser/documents/myproject.aep\",\n    \"composition\": \"main\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Job with Assets Example\n```json\n// myjob.json\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"src\": \"file:///d:/documents/myproject.aep\",\n    \"composition\": \"main\"\n  },\n  \"assets\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"file:///d:/images/myimage.png\",\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"layerName\": \"background.png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Job with Actions Example\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\":{\n    \"postrender\": [\n      {\n        \"module\": \"my-awesome-nexrender-action\",\n        \"param1\": \"something big\",\n        \"param2\": 15\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Network Rendering Setup\n\n### Server Setup\nA CLI application which is responsible for job management, worker node cooperation, communications with the nexrender-worker instances, and serves mainly as a producer in the nexrender network model. Technically speaking its a very tiny HTTP server running with a minimal version of REST API.(no content)```bash\nmkdir nexrender-server\ncd nexrender-server\nnpm init -y\nnpm install nexrender-server\nnexrender-server\n```\n\n### Worker Setup\nA CLI application which is responsible mainly for actual job processing and rendering, communication with the nexrender-server, and serves mainly as a consumer in the nexrender network model.\n\n### Submitting Jobs to Server\nThere are 2 main ways to do that, first one â€” just send a direct POST request to add a job to the server. Another option is to use already created API module for js:(no content)```sh\ncurl \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --header \"nexrender-secret: myapisecret\" \\\n  --header \"content-type: application/json\" \\\n  --data '{\"template\":{\"src\":\"http://my.server.com/assets/project.aep\",\"composition\":\"main\"}}' \\\n  http://my.server.com:3050/api/v1/jobs\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- It's recommended to run nexrender-cli -h at least once, to read all useful information about available options.\n- Check out supported protocols for src field.\n- When rendering is gonna happen, nexrender will copy/download this asset file, and attempt to find and replace footage entry by specified layer name. Check out: detailed information about footage items.\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers the basics of nexrender installation, setup, and job configuration.

There are two main action types - postrender and prerender. The latter can be used to process data/assets just before the actual render will start.\n\n## Built-in Actions\n\nSeveral built-in actions are available including:\n- HarryLafranc/nexrender-action-handbrake - Encode a video with Handbrake on nexrender-postrender\n- dberget/nexrender-action-cloudinary - Upload a video to Cloudinary platform\n- dberget/nexrender-action-normalize-color - Normalize colors for each asset defined in options\n- dylangarcia/nexrender-action-unzip - Unzip composition source before starting to render\n- pilskalns/nexrender-action-template-unzip - Unzip template and find (first) .aep file within it(no content)Additional actions include:\n- oreporan/nexrender-action-upload-s3-presigned - A postrender upload plugin which uploads using https (for s3 presigned_url)\n- pulsedemon/nexrender-action-run-command - Run shell commands as a nexrender action\n- oksr/nexrender-action-slack-message - Utility module for sending a Slack message when render start/finish or render error\n\n## Workflow Examples\n\n### Basic Postrender Workflow\nHere's a basic postrender workflow example:\n```json\n{\n  \"template\": {\n    \"src\": \"http://example.com/assets/myproject.aep\",\n    \"composition\": \"main\"\n  },\n  \"assets\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"http://example.com/assets/myimage.png\",\n      \"type\": \"image\",\n      \"layerName\": \"background.png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"actions\": {\n    \"postrender\": [\n      {\n        \"module\": \"@nexrender/action-encode\",\n        \"preset\": \"mp4\",\n        \"output\": \"encoded.mp4\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"module\": \"@nexrender/action-copy\",\n        \"input\": \"encoded.mp4\",\n        \"output\": \"d:/mydocuments/results/myresult.mp4\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n### Prerender Image Processing Example\nA prerender workflow for image transformation:\n```json\n{\n  \"actions\": {\n    \"prerender\": [\n      {\n        \"module\": \"@nexrender/image-transform\",\n        \"input\": \"background.jpg\",\n        \"operations\": [\n          { \"resize\": [1920, 1080] }\n        ],\n        \"output\": \"background.jpg\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"module\": \"@nexrender/image-transform\",\n        \"input\": \"MyNicePicture.jpg\",\n        \"operations\": [\n          { \"rotate\": [90] },\n          { \"blur\": [5] },\n          { \"color\": [{ \"apply\": \"red\", \"params\": [100] }] },\n          { \"resize\": [800, 600] }\n        ],\n        \"output\": \"MyNicePicture.jpg\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n## Custom Actions Development\n\nYou can define custom actions programmatically:\n```javascript\nconst {start} = require(\"@nexrender/worker\");\nconst myCustomAction = (job, settings, {input, params}, type) => {\n  // Whatever the action needs to do\n};\nstart(process.env.NEXRENDER_HOST, process.env.NEXRENDER_SECRET, {\n  workpath: projectsPath,\n  actions: {\n    \"custom-action\": myCustomAction\n  }\n});\n```(no content)To create custom pre- or post-render actions, you need to create at least a single file that returns a function with promise.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nActions are order-sensitive - if you put an encoding action after upload, the latter might not find the file that needs to be generated by the former, since the ordering was wrong.\n\nBoth job and settings are mutable structures, any modifications made to them will reflect onto the flow of the next calls.

The latter can be used to process data/assets just before the actual render will start.\\n\\n## Built-in Actions\\n\\nSeveral built-in actions are available including:\\n- HarryLafranc/nexrender-action-handbrake - Encode a video with Handbrake on nexrender-postrender\\n- dberget/nexrender-action-cloudinary - Upload a video to Cloudinary platform\\n- dberget/nexrender-action-normalize-color - Normalize colors for each asset defined in options\\n- dylangarcia/nexrender-action-unzip - Unzip composition source before starting to render\\n- pilskalns/nexrender-action-template-unzip - Unzip template and find (first) .aep file within it(no content)Additional actions include:\\n- oreporan/nexrender-action-upload-s3-presigned - A postrender upload plugin which uploads using https (for s3 presigned_url)\\n- pulsedemon/nexrender-action-run-command - Run shell commands as a nexrender action\\n- oksr/nexrender-action-slack-message - Utility module for sending a Slack message when render start/finish or render error\\n\\n## Workflow Examples\\n\\n### Basic Postrender Workflow\\nHere's a basic postrender workflow example:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"template\\\": {\\n    \\\"src\\\": \\\"http://example.com/assets/myproject.aep\\\",\\n    \\\"composition\\\": \\\"main\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"assets\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"src\\\": \\\"http://example.com/assets/myimage.png\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"image\\\",\\n      \\\"layerName\\\": \\\"background.png\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"actions\\\": {\\n    \\\"postrender\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"module\\\": \\\"@nexrender/action-encode\\\",\\n        \\\"preset\\\": \\\"mp4\\\",\\n        \\\"output\\\": \\\"encoded.mp4\\\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \\\"module\\\": \\\"@nexrender/action-copy\\\",\\n        \\\"input\\\": \\\"encoded.mp4\\\",\\n        \\\"output\\\": \\\"d:/mydocuments/results/myresult.mp4\\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n### Prerender Image Processing Example\\nA prerender workflow for image transformation:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"actions\\\": {\\n    \\\"prerender\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"module\\\": \\\"@nexrender/image-transform\\\",\\n        \\\"input\\\": \\\"background.jpg\\\",\\n        \\\"operations\\\": [\\n          { \\\"resize\\\": [1920, 1080] }\\n        ],\\n        \\\"output\\\": \\\"background.jpg\\\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \\\"module\\\": \\\"@nexrender/image-transform\\\",\\n        \\\"input\\\": \\\"MyNicePicture.jpg\\\",\\n        \\\"operations\\\": [\\n          { \\\"rotate\\\": [90] },\\n          { \\\"blur\\\": [5] },\\n          { \\\"color\\\": [{ \\\"apply\\\": \\\"red\\\", \\\"params\\\": [100] }] },\\n          { \\\"resize\\\": [800, 600] }\\n        ],\\n        \\\"output\\\": \\\"MyNicePicture.jpg\\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n## Custom Actions Development\\n\\nYou can define custom actions programmatically:\\n```javascript\\nconst {start} = require(\\\"@nexrender/worker\\\");\\nconst myCustomAction = (job, settings, {input, params}, type) => {\\n  // Whatever the action needs to do\\n};\\nstart(process.env.NEXRENDER_HOST, process.env.NEXRENDER_SECRET, {\\n  workpath: projectsPath,\\n  actions: {\\n    \\\"custom-action\\\": myCustomAction\\n  }\\n});\\n```(no content)To create custom pre- or post-render actions, you need to create at least a single file that returns a function with promise.\\n\\n## Important Notes\\n\\nActions are order-sensitive - if you put an encoding action after upload, the latter might not find the file that needs to be generated by the former, since the ordering was wrong.\\n\\nBoth job and settings are mutable structures, any modifications made to them will reflect onto the flow of the next calls. Hence they can be used to store state between actions.\\n\\nPre-render and post-render actions are not really different from each other - they both require a function that returns a promise.\\n\\nThese examples show how nexrender provides a flexible system for automating After Effects workflows with various pre and post-processing capabilities through its action system.\"],\"durationSeconds\":40.81893137500001}}"}
