# Setup: Initialize Next.js Project

## Overview
Create a new Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript, App Router, and Tailwind CSS. This establishes the foundation for the After Effects Render Manager web application.

## Technical Requirements
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Enable App Router (not Pages Router)
- Configure Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Configure TypeScript for strict mode
- Create basic folder structure following Next.js conventions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next.js project created with TypeScript enabled
- [ ] App Router directory structure in place
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured and working
- [ ] ESLint configured with Next.js rules
- [ ] TypeScript set to strict mode in tsconfig.json
- [ ] .gitignore includes standard Next.js exclusions
- [ ] Package.json includes required scripts (dev, build, start, lint)
- [ ] Project runs successfully with `npm run dev`

## Implementation Notes
- Use `npx create-next-app@latest` with appropriate flags
- Select TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and App Router when prompted
- Do not use `src/` directory - keep app directory at root level
- Configure absolute imports with `@/` prefix

## Out of Scope
- Authentication setup (handled in separate task)
- Database configuration (handled in separate task)
- External API integrations
- Custom UI components
