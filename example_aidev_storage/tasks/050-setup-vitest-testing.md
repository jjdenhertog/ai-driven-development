# Setup: Testing Framework with Vitest

## Overview
Install and configure Vitest with React Testing Library for unit and integration testing of the Next.js application.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want automated testing so that I can ensure code quality
- As a developer, I want fast test execution so that I can get quick feedback

## Technical Requirements
- Vitest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- TypeScript support
- Coverage reporting
- Test utilities setup
- Mock configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vitest installed and configured
- [ ] React Testing Library set up
- [ ] Test scripts in package.json
- [ ] Coverage reporting enabled
- [ ] Sample test passing
- [ ] Test utilities created

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Target
- Framework configuration validation

### Required Test Types (if testing infrastructure exists)
- **Sample Tests**: Basic component test
- **Configuration Tests**: Setup working correctly

### Test Scenarios
#### Happy Path
- [ ] Test runner executes successfully
- [ ] Component tests work
- [ ] Coverage generated

## Implementation Notes
Install packages:
- vitest
- @vitejs/plugin-react
- @testing-library/react
- @testing-library/jest-dom
- @testing-library/user-event
- jsdom
- @vitest/coverage-v8

Configure:
- vitest.config.ts
- src/test/setup.ts
- src/test/utils.tsx

## Code Reuse
- Standard testing patterns
- Custom render utilities

## Examples to Reference
- Vitest with Next.js examples
- React Testing Library patterns

## Documentation Links
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Potential Gotchas
- Next.js specific configurations
- Module aliases in tests
- Mock setup for App Router

## Out of Scope
- E2E testing setup
- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing

## Testing Notes
- Create example tests
- Verify all configurations work
