# Feature: Admin Dashboard Interface

## Overview
Build the administrative dashboard for monitoring and controlling the render queue, viewing system health, managing jobs, and performing system updates. This provides complete visibility and control over the render manager.

Creating task because concept states at lines 148-197: "User Interface Requirements" with detailed dashboard views and line 229-238: "Admin Monitoring Flow"

## User Stories
- As an admin, I want to monitor all active jobs so I can track system usage
- As an admin, I want to control individual jobs so I can manage priorities
- As an admin, I want to see system health so I can prevent issues

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time job list with filtering and sorting
- WebSocket updates for active jobs
- Job detail view with logs and progress
- System health metrics display
- Emergency controls (stop all, clear queue)
- Manual update triggering
- Responsive Material-UI interface
- Role-based access control (ADMIN only)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Job list displays with real-time updates
- [ ] Filtering by status, user, date works
- [ ] Sorting by date, priority, status works
- [ ] Job details show complete information
- [ ] Render logs display in real-time
- [ ] System health metrics accurate
- [ ] Emergency stop cancels all jobs
- [ ] Queue clear removes pending jobs
- [ ] Update check shows available versions
- [ ] Update execution works correctly

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Target
- Dashboard components: 85% coverage
- Admin actions: 100% coverage
- Real-time updates: 80% coverage

### Required Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Filter/sort logic, date formatting, status helpers
- **Component Tests**: All dashboard components
- **Integration Tests**: WebSocket updates, API calls
- **E2E Tests**: Complete admin workflows

### Test Scenarios
#### Happy Path
- [ ] Dashboard loads with job data
- [ ] Real-time updates reflect changes
- [ ] Admin actions execute successfully

#### Error Handling
- [ ] API failures show error state
- [ ] WebSocket reconnects automatically
- [ ] Failed actions show notifications

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty queue displays properly
- [ ] Large job lists paginate
- [ ] Concurrent updates handled

## Implementation Notes
- Use MUI DataGrid for job list
- Implement WebSocket with socket.io
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Show confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Cache filters in URL parameters

## Dashboard Components

```typescript
// Main dashboard structure
<AdminDashboard>
  <SystemHealthBar />
  <JobFilters />
  <JobList>
    <JobRow />
  </JobList>
  <JobDetailModal />
  <SystemControlPanel />
</AdminDashboard>

// System health metrics
interface SystemHealth {
  cpuUsage: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  diskSpace: number;
  queueDepth: number;
  activeRender: boolean;
  renderProgress: number;
}

// Admin controls
interface AdminActions {
  emergencyStop(): Promise<void>;
  clearQueue(): Promise<void>;
  restartEngine(): Promise<void>;
  checkUpdate(): Promise<UpdateInfo>;
  executeUpdate(): Promise<void>;
  boostPriority(jobId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Examples to Reference
- `.aidev-worktree/examples/components/UsersDataTable.tsx` for table patterns
- `.aidev-worktree/preferences/components.md` for component structure
- MUI DataGrid documentation

## Documentation Links
- [MUI DataGrid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/)
- [Socket.io Client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

## Potential Gotchas
- DataGrid requires license for some features
- WebSocket connections need error handling
- Real-time updates can cause performance issues
- Admin role must be strictly enforced

## Out of Scope
- Analytics dashboard
- Historical statistics
- Export functionality
- Bulk operations UI
- Mobile app

## Testing Notes
- Mock WebSocket for tests
- Test with large datasets
- Verify role-based access
- Test real-time synchronization
