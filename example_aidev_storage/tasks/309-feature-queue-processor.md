# Feature: Queue Processor Service

## Description
Create the background service that continuously processes the job queue, executing renders sequentially and handling failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Start automatically with application
- [ ] Process one job at a time
- [ ] Select highest priority pending job
- [ ] Execute validation -> render -> completion flow
- [ ] Handle render failures (mark as failed)
- [ ] Continue processing after failures
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on app stop

## Component Specifications
```yaml
service:
  QueueProcessor:
    lifecycle:
      - start(): Start processing loop
      - stop(): Graceful shutdown
      - isRunning: boolean
    
    processing_loop:
      1. Check for pending jobs
      2. Select highest priority
      3. Update status to VALIDATING
      4. Run file validation
      5. Update status to RENDERING
      6. Execute nexrender (placeholder)
      7. Track progress
      8. Update status to COMPLETED/FAILED
      9. Repeat
    
    error_handling:
      - Validation failure: Mark FAILED with reason
      - Render crash: Mark FAILED with logs
      - Unexpected error: Log and continue
```

## Test Specifications
```yaml
integration_tests:
  - "Processes jobs in priority order"
  - "Handles validation failures"
  - "Handles render failures"
  - "Continues after job failure"
  - "Stops gracefully on shutdown"
  - "Resumes processing on restart"
```

## Code Reuse
- Use JobQueueService from task 301
- Use FileValidationService from task 302
- Use NexrenderService from task 303
- Use JobProgressTracker from task 304
