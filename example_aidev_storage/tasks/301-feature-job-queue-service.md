# Feature: Job Queue Service

## Description
Create the core job queue service that manages job lifecycle, processes the queue sequentially, and handles state transitions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sequential job processing (one at a time)
- [ ] Priority-based job selection (higher number = higher priority)
- [ ] Job state machine with proper transitions
- [ ] Queue monitoring and depth tracking
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Error recovery for failed jobs
- [ ] Event emitter for job status changes

## Component Specifications
```yaml
services:
  JobQueueService:
    properties:
      - isProcessing: boolean
      - currentJob: Job  < /dev/null |  null
    
    methods:
      - start(): Promise<void>
      - stop(): Promise<void>
      - submitJob(jobData: CreateJobDto): Promise<Job>
      - processNext(): Promise<void>
      - updateJobStatus(id: string, status: JobStatus, error?: string): Promise<void>
      - cancelJob(id: string): Promise<void>
      - getQueueStatus(): QueueStatus
    
    events:
      - jobStarted: (job: Job) => void
      - jobCompleted: (job: Job) => void
      - jobFailed: (job: Job, error: string) => void
      - queueEmpty: () => void
```

## State Transitions
```yaml
states:
  PENDING: 
    - next: [VALIDATING, CANCELLED]
  VALIDATING:
    - next: [QUEUED, FAILED, CANCELLED]
  QUEUED:
    - next: [RENDERING, CANCELLED]
  RENDERING:
    - next: [COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED]
  COMPLETED:
    - final: true
  FAILED:
    - final: true
  CANCELLED:
    - final: true
```

## Test Specifications
```yaml
unit_tests:
  - "Processes jobs in priority order"
  - "Handles only one job at a time"
  - "Transitions states correctly"
  - "Cancels jobs with same path on submission"
  - "Emits events for status changes"
  - "Recovers from processing errors"
  - "Stops gracefully when requested"
```

## Code Reuse
- Use JobRepository from task 300
- Apply event emitter patterns
- Use job status enum from schema
