# Database: Setup Prisma with SQLite

## Overview
Initialize Prisma ORM with SQLite database for local data persistence, including configuration and initial setup.

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want a database ORM so that I can work with data efficiently
- As a developer, I want SQLite so that deployment is simple

## Technical Requirements
- Prisma ORM initialization
- SQLite database configuration
- Development and production setup
- Database client singleton pattern

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prisma initialized with SQLite provider
- [ ] Database file created in correct location
- [ ] Prisma Client generated
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Development scripts added to package.json

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Target
- Database connection testing

### Required Test Types (if testing infrastructure exists)
- **Integration Tests**: Database connection works
- **Unit Tests**: Prisma client singleton pattern

### Test Scenarios
#### Happy Path
- [ ] Database connects successfully
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations work
- [ ] Migrations apply correctly

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Handle database connection errors
- [ ] Handle file permission issues

## Implementation Notes
- Run `npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite`
- Configure schema.prisma with proper settings
- Create lib/prisma.ts for client singleton
- Add Prisma scripts to package.json:
  - db:push - Push schema changes
  - db:migrate - Run migrations
  - db:studio - Open Prisma Studio
  - db:generate - Generate client

## Code Reuse
- Use database client pattern from pattern_specifications.json

## Examples to Reference
- Database client singleton pattern in patterns

## Documentation Links
- [Prisma with SQLite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite)
- [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client)

## Potential Gotchas
- SQLite file permissions on Windows
- Database file location in production
- Connection pool not needed for SQLite

## Out of Scope
- Schema definition (separate tasks)
- Seed data setup
- Backup configuration

## Testing Notes
- Test database connection
- Verify client singleton works properly
