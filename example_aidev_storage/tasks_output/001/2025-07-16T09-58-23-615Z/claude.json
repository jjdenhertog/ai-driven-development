Here's what I found:\n\n### ‚úÖ **Files That Exist:**\n\n1. **Task Definition Files:**\n   - `/Users/jjdenhertog/Projects/mig-afx-render-manager/.aidev-storage/tasks/001-setup-nextjs-project.json` ‚úì\n   - `/Users/jjdenhertog/Projects/mig-afx-render-manager/.aidev-storage/tasks/001-setup-nextjs-project.md` ‚úì\n\n2. **Task Output Files:**\n   - `/Users/jjdenhertog/Projects/mig-afx-render-manager/.aidev-storage/tasks_output/001/prp.md` ‚úì\n   - `/Users/jjdenhertog/Projects/mig-afx-render-manager/.aidev-storage/tasks_output/001/user_changes.json` ‚úì\n   - `/Users/jjdenhertog/Projects/mig-afx-render-manager/.aidev-storage/tasks_output/001/last_result.md` ‚úì\n\n### üìä **File Content Analysis:**\n\n1. **prp.md file:**\n   - ‚úÖ Has content (877 lines)\n   - ‚úÖ Contains a complete PRP (Pattern Reference Plan) for the Next.js setup task\n   - ‚úÖ Includes all required sections: Goal, Task Details, Research Phase, Implementation Plan, etc.\n\n2. **user_changes.json file:**\n   - ‚úÖ Valid JSON format\n   - ‚úÖ Contains a single commit with hash `848336b4ca6cb2ea7b40f91497c2ffc5c62b8d9f`\n   - ‚úÖ Documents changes to 5 files: `app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `src/lib/theme.ts`, `src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`\n   - ‚úÖ Shows formatting/style changes made by the user (primarily indentation and type definition style changes)\n\n3. **Task JSON file:**\n   - ‚úÖ Shows task 001 is marked as \"completed\"\n   - ‚úÖ Has proper structure with all required fields\n\n4. **Task Markdown file:**\n   - ‚úÖ Contains complete task specification\n   - ‚úÖ Matches the task definition in the JSON file\n\n5. **last_result.md file:**\n   - ‚úÖ Contains the PR message for the completed task\n   - ‚úÖ Summarizes the implementation and validation steps\n\n### üéØ **Recommendations:**\n\n1. **All required files are present** - The /aidev-learn command should work properly with task `001-setup-nextjs-project`.\n\n2. **The user_changes.json shows only formatting changes** - This indicates the user accepted the AI's implementation but made style/formatting adjustments. These are valuable learning data for understanding the user's code style preferences.\n\n3. **The setup appears complete and functional** - All necessary files exist with proper content, and the task is marked as completed.\n\n4. **Next steps:**\n   - The /aidev-learn command should be able to process this task successfully\n   - The formatting changes in user_changes.json provide good learning material about code style preferences\n   - Consider running `/aidev-learn 001-setup-nextjs-project` to test the learning functionality\n\nThe setup looks properly configured and ready for the /aidev-learn command to process the task data!"
