# Codebase Indexation Report

## Summary
The indexation phase was executed on an uninitialized Next.js project directory.

## Status
âœ… **Completed** - Empty index structure created

## Findings
- Project directory exists but contains no source code
- No React components, hooks, utilities, or API routes found
- Index files created with empty structures for future use

## Index Files Created
1. `components.json` - Ready for React components
2. `hooks.json` - Ready for custom React hooks  
3. `utilities.json` - Ready for utility functions
4. `styles.json` - Ready for CSS/SCSS classes

6. `api_routes.json` - Ready for API endpoints
7. `patterns.json` - Ready for pattern detection
8. `metadata.json` - Contains index metadata
9. `search_index.json` - Ready for unified search

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js project
2. Re-run indexation after project setup
3. Use incremental updates as code is added

## Statistics
- Total source files: 0
- Total indexed items: 0
- Project status: Uninitialized
