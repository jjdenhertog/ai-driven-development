# Feature: User Authentication

## Overview
Implement a complete user authentication system with email/password and OAuth providers (Google, GitHub). Users should be able to sign up, sign in, manage their sessions, and securely log out.

## User Stories
- As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password so that I can create an account
- As a returning user, I want to sign in with Google/GitHub so that I don't need to remember another password
- As a logged-in user, I want my session to persist so that I don't need to log in repeatedly
- As a security-conscious user, I want to securely log out so that others can't access my account

## Technical Requirements
- NextAuth.js for authentication handling
- Support for email/password authentication
- OAuth integration with Google and GitHub providers
- Session storage in Redis for scalability
- Secure cookie-based session management
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully sign up with email/password
- [ ] Email validation is performed (format and uniqueness)
- [ ] Users can sign in with Google OAuth
- [ ] Users can sign in with GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Sessions persist for 7 days by default
- [ ] Logout clears all session data from Redis and cookies
- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- [ ] Loading states during authentication
- [ ] Redirect to dashboard after successful login
- [ ] Redirect to login when accessing protected routes while logged out

## Testing Requirements

**Note**: Testing requirements only apply if testing infrastructure is available in the project. If no testing framework is set up, tests will be created when the testing infrastructure task is completed.

### Test Coverage Target
- Minimum 80% coverage for all authentication code (when testing is available)
- 100% coverage for auth validation logic (when testing is available)
- 100% coverage for session management (when testing is available)

### Required Test Types (if testing infrastructure exists)
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Password hashing utilities
  - Email validation functions
  - Session token generation
  - Auth middleware logic
- **Component Tests**: 
  - LoginForm component with all states
  - SignupForm component with validation
  - OAuthButton components
  - AuthProvider context
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - NextAuth configuration
  - Redis session storage
  - Protected route behavior
- **E2E Tests**: 
  - Complete signup flow
  - Login with email/password
  - OAuth login flows
  - Logout functionality
  - Session persistence

### Test Scenarios
#### Happy Path
- [ ] User can sign up with valid email/password
- [ ] User can log in with correct credentials
- [ ] OAuth login redirects and completes successfully
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Logout clears session completely

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid email format shows error message
- [ ] Duplicate email shows "already exists" error
- [ ] Wrong password shows "invalid credentials"
- [ ] OAuth failure shows friendly error
- [ ] Redis connection failure falls back gracefully

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Very long email addresses handled
- [ ] Special characters in passwords work
- [ ] Rapid login attempts are rate limited
- [ ] Concurrent sessions handled properly
- [ ] Session expiry redirects to login

### Test File Locations (when testing is available)
- Component tests: 
  - `components/auth/LoginForm.test.tsx`
  - `components/auth/SignupForm.test.tsx`
  - `components/auth/OAuthButton.test.tsx`
- API route tests: 
  - `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/auth/signup/route.test.ts`
- E2E tests: 
  - `e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/oauth-login.spec.ts`
- Test utilities: 
  - `src/test-utils/auth-helpers.ts`
  - `src/test-utils/mock-session.ts`

**Note**: If testing infrastructure is not yet set up, these tests will be created after the testing setup task is completed.

## Implementation Notes
- Use NextAuth with custom Redis adapter
- Follow the established API pattern from `000-pattern-api`
- Use the standard component structure from `000-pattern-component`
- Implement proper TypeScript types for User and Session
- Use Zod for validation schemas
- Include rate limiting middleware

## Examples to Reference
- `.aidev/examples/components/LoginForm.tsx` - form component patterns
- `.aidev/examples/api/auth/` - authentication API patterns
- `.aidev/examples/middleware/auth.ts` - middleware patterns

## Documentation Links
- https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization
- https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/redis
- https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google
- https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github

## Potential Gotchas
- OAuth redirect URLs must be configured in provider dashboards
- NEXTAUTH_URL must be set correctly for production
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET must be generated and kept secure
- Redis connection must be established before auth requests
- Email provider requires SMTP configuration

## Out of Scope
- Password reset functionality (separate feature)
- Two-factor authentication (future enhancement)
- Social login beyond Google/GitHub
- User profile management (separate feature)

## Testing Notes
- Mock NextAuth for component tests using custom test utilities
- Use MSW to mock OAuth provider responses
- Create test user factory for consistent test data
- Mock Redis client for unit tests
- E2E tests should clean up test users after each run
- Performance: Login should complete in < 2 seconds
- Use Playwright's auth state feature for E2E test efficiency
- **Infrastructure Check**: Implementation will check for testing setup before creating tests
- **Fallback**: If no testing available, authentication will be implemented without tests (not recommended for security-critical features)
