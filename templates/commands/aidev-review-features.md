# aidev-review-features

This command performs a thorough analysis of the concept and all queued features to predict the outcome of implementing them. It simulates running `aidev-next-task` for each feature to determine if the implementation will successfully produce the desired concept.

## Usage

```bash
npm run aidev-review-features
```

## Purpose

1. **Verify Feature Completeness**: Ensure all features in the queue will produce the desired concept
2. **Identify Missing Information**: Detect hallucinated or missing requirements
3. **Consult User**: Gather additional information to refine features
4. **Predict Outcomes**: Simulate the implementation of each feature
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Update features based on user feedback and re-verify
6. **Verify User Preferences**: Ensure features align with user preferences and examples

## Command Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis

1. **Load Project Context**
   - Read the concept from `.aidev/concept/`
   - Analyze existing source code and implemented features
   - Load all queued features from `.aidev/features/queue/`
   - Skip completed features (they're already in the codebase)
   - **Load all user preferences dynamically**:
     ```bash
     # Find and load all .md preference files
     find .aidev/preferences -name "*.md" -type f
     ```
   - Load user examples from `.aidev/templates/examples/`

2. **Concept Analysis**
   - Parse the concept to understand:
     - Core functionality requirements
     - User experience expectations
     - Technical architecture needs
     - Integration requirements
     - Performance and quality standards

3. **User Preferences Analysis**
   - Parse all .md files in preferences directory to understand:
     - Any technology stack preferences
     - Any component patterns and naming conventions
     - Any API design patterns
     - Any state management preferences
     - Any styling approaches specified
     - Any code organization and folder structure
     - Any other custom preferences defined in .md files
   - New preference files can be added anytime and will be considered
   - Dynamically adapt to whatever preferences are found

4. **Feature Inventory**
   - List all queued features with their:
     - Dependencies
     - Requirements
     - Expected outcomes
     - Integration points
     - Alignment with user preferences

### Phase 2: Deep Feature Analysis

For each queued feature, simulate the `aidev-next-task` execution:

1. **Context Simulation**
   - Consider existing code and patterns
   - Account for completed dependencies
   - Evaluate available libraries and tools
   - Check alignment with user's preferred patterns

2. **Implementation Prediction**
   - Predict the code structure that would be generated
   - Identify required imports and dependencies
   - Determine integration points with existing code
   - Assess potential side effects
   - Verify adherence to user's coding conventions

3. **Preference Compliance Check**
   - **Component Patterns**:
     - Verify use of B-prefixed components (BTextField, BCheckbox)
     - Check for proper sx prop usage vs CSS modules
     - Ensure functional component patterns with arrow functions
   - **State Management**:
     - Confirm Zustand usage for global state
     - Verify TanStack Query for server state
     - Check proper middleware usage (immer, devtools, persist)
   - **API Patterns**:
     - Validate Next.js API route structure
     - Check for proper error handling patterns
     - Ensure consistent response formats

4. **Gap Detection**
   - **Missing Information**:
     - Undefined API endpoints or schemas
     - Unspecified UI/UX details
     - Missing business logic rules
     - Unclear data relationships
   - **Preference Deviations**:
     - Non-standard component naming
     - Incorrect state management approach
     - Improper folder structure
     - Missing TypeScript types
   - **Hallucinated Requirements**:
     - References to non-existent systems
     - Assumptions about external services
     - Invented configuration requirements
   - **Technical Gaps**:
     - Missing dependencies in package.json
     - Incompatible library versions
     - Unimplemented base components

### Phase 3: User Consultation

1. **Generate Questions**
   - Organize issues by feature and severity
   - Group related questions together
   - Provide context for each question
   - Highlight preference violations

2. **Present Analysis**
   ```
   üîç Feature Review Analysis
   
   ‚úÖ Features that appear complete: [count]
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Features with issues: [count]
   ‚ùå Features with blocking issues: [count]
   üé® Features not matching preferences: [count]
   
   ## Issues Found:
   
   ### Feature: [feature-name]
   - Issue: [description]
   - Impact: [how this affects the concept]
   - Question: [what we need from the user]
   
   ### Preference Violations:
   - Component Pattern: [expected vs found]
   - State Management: [expected vs found]
   - Code Style: [expected vs found]
   ```

3. **Collect Responses**
   - Allow user to:
     - Provide missing information
     - Clarify requirements
     - Modify feature scope
     - Add new features if gaps exist
     - Update preferences if needed
     - Confirm preference adherence

### Phase 4: Feature Updates

1. **Update Feature Files**
   - Incorporate user feedback into feature definitions
   - Add clarifications to requirements
   - Update dependencies if needed

2. **Document Changes**
   - Create a review log in `.aidev/sessions/`
   - Track all modifications made
   - Note user decisions and clarifications

### Phase 5: Re-verification

1. **Repeat Simulation**
   - Re-run the analysis with updated features
   - Verify all issues have been resolved
   - Ensure no new issues introduced

2. **Final Outcome Prediction**
   - Generate a comprehensive report showing:
     - How each feature contributes to the concept
     - The expected final product structure
     - Any remaining risks or uncertainties

## Output Format

The command produces a detailed report:

```

2. [Specific action item]
3. [Update features to match preferences]

## User Consultation Required

```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

- **Works with partial codebases**: Analyzes existing code alongside queued features
- **Respects completed features**: Only analyzes queued features, assumes completed ones are correct
- **Updates feature definitions**: Can modify feature files based on user input
- **Creates audit trail**: Documents all changes and decisions

## Error Handling

- If no concept found: Prompts user to create one
- If no features found: Indicates project is complete or needs feature generation
- If critical dependencies missing: Highlights blockers clearly
- If user skips questions: Documents as "unresolved" and continues

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Missing API Details
```
Feature: user-authentication
Issue: References "auth API" but no endpoints specified
Question: What authentication service will be used? (Auth0, NextAuth, custom?)
```

### Scenario 2: Hallucinated Dependency
```
Feature: data-visualization  
Issue: Assumes "ChartMagic" library exists
Question: Should we use Chart.js, D3, or another visualization library?
```

### Scenario 3: Incomplete UI Specification
```
Feature: dashboard-layout
Issue: No mobile responsive requirements specified
Question: Should the dashboard be mobile-responsive? What's the minimum supported screen size?
```

### Scenario 4: Preference Deviation
```
Feature: user-form
Issue: Uses plain TextField instead of BTextField
Expected: BTextField component as per user preferences
Action: Update feature to use custom B-prefixed components
```

### Scenario 5: State Management Mismatch
```
Feature: shopping-cart
Issue: Implements Redux for state management
Expected: Zustand with immer/devtools/persist
Action: Refactor to use preferred state management solution
```

### Scenario 6: Component Pattern Violation
```
Feature: product-card
Issue: Uses styled-components for styling
Expected: MUI sx prop or CSS Modules
Action: Update styling approach to match preferences
```

## Success Criteria

The command succeeds when:
1. All queued features have been analyzed
2. All identified issues have been addressed or documented
3. The predicted outcome matches the concept requirements
4. User has confirmed or updated all unclear requirements
5. All features comply with user preferences and examples
6. A complete review report has been generated

## Notes

- This command is non-destructive (only updates feature files with user consent)
- Can be run multiple times as features are added or modified
- Particularly useful before starting a major implementation phase
- Helps prevent wasted effort on incomplete specifications
- Automatically checks for preference compliance when user updates preferences or examples
- Ensures consistent code style across all features
