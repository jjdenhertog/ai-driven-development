# üîêüîêüîê CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SECURE ALL VULNERABILITIES! üîêüîêüîê

**THIS IS NOT A REPORTING TASK - THIS IS A SECURING TASK!**

When you run `/aidev-check-security`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **IDENTIFY** all security vulnerabilities, exposures, and risks
2. **FIX EVERY SINGLE ONE** - not just report them!
3. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** to fix security issues in parallel:
   - Spawn one agent to fix authentication vulnerabilities
   - Spawn another to secure API endpoints
   - Spawn more agents for input validation issues
   - Spawn agents for dependency vulnerabilities
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to fix all these security issues in parallel"
4. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ‚úÖ ALL sensitive data is secured
   - ‚úÖ NO credentials exposed in frontend
   - ‚úÖ ALL inputs are validated and sanitized
   - ‚úÖ ALL API endpoints are protected
   - ‚úÖ NO XSS vulnerabilities exist
   - ‚úÖ NO SQL injection possibilities
   - ‚úÖ EVERYTHING is SECURE

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**

- ‚ùå "Here are the security issues I found" ‚Üí NO! SECURE THEM!
- ‚ùå "API keys are exposed in..." ‚Üí NO! HIDE THEM!
- ‚ùå "This input could be vulnerable to..." ‚Üí NO! SECURE IT!
- ‚ùå "Authentication might be weak..." ‚Üí NO! STRENGTHEN IT!
- ‚ùå Stopping after listing vulnerabilities ‚Üí NO! KEEP WORKING!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

```
1. Run security scans ‚Üí Find vulnerabilities
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents to fix ALL issues
3. Re-run security checks ‚Üí Find remaining issues
4. Secure those too
5. REPEAT until EVERYTHING is secure
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**

- No sensitive data exposed in frontend bundles
- All API keys and secrets in environment variables
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- All API endpoints have proper authentication
- No XSS, CSRF, or injection vulnerabilities
- All dependencies are updated and secure
- Security headers are properly configured
- Everything shows secure status

üõ°Ô∏è **MANDATORY SECURITY PRE-FLIGHT CHECK** üõ°Ô∏è

1. Re-read CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current .claude/TODO.md status
3. Verify you're not declaring "secure" prematurely

Execute comprehensive security audit with ZERO tolerance for vulnerabilities.

**FORBIDDEN EXCUSE PATTERNS:**

- "This is just a minor exposure" ‚Üí NO, all exposures are critical
- "It's internal data" ‚Üí NO, secure everything
- "Users won't access this" ‚Üí NO, assume they will
- "It's behind authentication" ‚Üí NO, defense in depth
- "It's a known library issue" ‚Üí NO, work around it
- "HTTPS will protect it" ‚Üí NO, that's not enough

Let me ultrathink about securing this codebase against all possible attack vectors.

üö® **REMEMBER: One security flaw can compromise the entire application!** üö®

**Universal Security Verification Protocol:**

**Step 0: Security Environment Check**

- Verify all environment variables are properly configured
- Check that .env files are not committed to version control
- Ensure production builds don't include debug information
- Scan for any hardcoded secrets in the codebase

**Step 1: Sensitive Data Exposure Scan**

- Search for API keys, passwords, tokens in all files
- Check for database credentials in code
- Look for hardcoded URLs and endpoints
- Scan for debug information in production builds
- Review environment variable usage

**Step 2: Input Validation & Sanitization**

Run comprehensive input security checks:

```bash
# Check for unvalidated inputs
grep -r "req.body" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -r "req.query" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -r "req.params" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Check for dangerous HTML rendering
grep -r "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" .

# Check for direct SQL queries
grep -r "SELECT\|INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
```

**Frontend Security Requirements:**

- NO API keys, secrets, or credentials in client-side code
- NO sensitive data in localStorage or sessionStorage
- NO direct database queries from frontend
- NO unencrypted sensitive data transmission
- NO XSS vulnerabilities through user input
- NO CSRF vulnerabilities in forms
- NO clickjacking vulnerabilities
- NO mixed content (HTTP resources over HTTPS)

**Backend/API Security Requirements:**

- ALL API endpoints require proper authentication
- ALL user inputs validated with schemas (Zod, Joi, etc.)
- ALL database queries use parameterized statements
- ALL file uploads are validated and sanitized
- ALL error messages don't expose sensitive information
- ALL API responses don't leak internal data
- ALL middleware implements proper security headers
- ALL routes implement rate limiting

**Step 3: Authentication & Authorization Security**

Verify authentication implementation:

- [ ] JWT tokens are properly signed and verified
- [ ] Session management is secure (httpOnly, secure flags)
- [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt or stronger
- [ ] Password reset flows are secure
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication implemented (if required)
- [ ] OAuth flows are properly implemented
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Session timeout is configured appropriately
- [ ] Brute force protection is implemented
- [ ] Account lockout policies are in place

**Step 4: API Security Audit**

```bash
# Check for unprotected API routes
find . -name "route.ts" -o -name "*.api.ts" | xargs grep -L "auth\|token\|session"

# Check for missing input validation
find . -name "route.ts" -o -name "*.api.ts" | xargs grep -L "validate\|schema\|zod"

# Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" | xargs grep -n "query.*+\|query.*\${" 
```

**Next.js Specific Security Checklist:**

- [ ] File size limits enforced
- [ ] Malicious file detection
- [ ] Files stored outside web root
- [ ] No executable files allowed
- [ ] Antivirus scanning implemented
- [ ] File content validation
- [ ] Secure file naming

**Step 7: Session Security**

- [ ] Session invalidation on logout
- [ ] No session data in URLs
- [ ] Session hijacking prevention
- [ ] Concurrent session limits

**Common Vulnerability Patterns to Fix:**

**1. Exposed Secrets:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - API key exposed
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef";

// ‚úÖ SECURE - Use environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

**2. Unvalidated Input:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - No validation
app.post('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email } = req.body;
  // Direct database insert
});

// ‚úÖ SECURE - Validate with schema
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

app.post('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  const validated = userSchema.parse(req.body);
  // Safe to use validated data
});
```

**3. XSS Vulnerability:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - XSS vulnerability
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} />

// ‚úÖ SECURE - Sanitize input
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)}} />
```

**4. SQL Injection:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå DANGEROUS - SQL injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ‚úÖ SECURE - Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

**Step 8: Security Testing**

Run security-focused tests:

```bash
# Static security analysis
npm run lint:security  # ESLint security rules
npm run audit:security # Security-focused audit

# Dynamic security testing
npm run test:security  # Security-focused test suites
```

**Failure Response Protocol:**

When security vulnerabilities are found:

1. **IMMEDIATELY SPAWN AGENTS** to fix vulnerabilities in parallel:
   ```
   "I found API keys exposed in 5 files, 12 unvalidated inputs, and 3 XSS vulnerabilities. I'll spawn agents to fix these:
   - Agent 1: Secure API keys and move to environment variables
   - Agent 2: Add input validation to all API endpoints
   - Agent 3: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in components
   - Agent 4: Update dependencies with security patches
   - Agent 5: Configure security headers
   Let me tackle all of these in parallel..."
   ```
2. **SECURE EVERYTHING** - Address EVERY vulnerability, no matter how "minor"
3. **VERIFY** - Re-run all security checks after fixes
4. **REPEAT** - If new vulnerabilities found, spawn more agents and fix those too
5. **NO STOPPING** - Keep working until ALL security checks show ‚úÖ SECURE
6. **NO EXCUSES** - Common invalid excuses:
   - "It's just test data" ‚Üí Secure it NOW
   - "Users won't access this" ‚Üí Assume they will NOW
   - "It's behind authentication" ‚Üí Defense in depth NOW
   - "HTTPS will protect it" ‚Üí That's not enough NOW
   - "It's a low-risk vulnerability" ‚Üí Fix it anyway NOW

**Critical Security Verification:**

The code is secure when:
‚úì No secrets in frontend code or version control
‚úì All inputs validated and sanitized
‚úì All API endpoints protected
‚úì No XSS vulnerabilities
‚úì No SQL injection possibilities
‚úì All dependencies updated and secure
‚úì Security headers configured
‚úì Authentication properly implemented
‚úì Authorization enforced on all routes
‚úì No sensitive data leakage
‚úì All security tests pass
‚úì Security audit tools show no issues

**Final Security Commitment:**

I will now execute EVERY security check listed above and FIX ALL VULNERABILITIES. I will:

- ‚úÖ Scan for all exposed secrets and secure them
- ‚úÖ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS to fix vulnerabilities in parallel
- ‚úÖ Keep working until EVERYTHING is secure
- ‚úÖ Verify with security tools and manual testing
- ‚úÖ Not stop until all security checks show passing status

I will NOT:

- ‚ùå Just report vulnerabilities without fixing them
- ‚ùå Skip any security checks
- ‚ùå Accept "low-risk" vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Ignore potential attack vectors
- ‚ùå Leave any security warnings
- ‚ùå Stop working while ANY vulnerabilities remain

**REMEMBER: This is a SECURING task, not a reporting task!**

The code is secure ONLY when every single security check shows ‚úÖ SECURE.
