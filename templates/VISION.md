# AI-Driven Development Vision

## Core Concept

This project implements an AI-driven development workflow where AI learns and improves through human feedback, creating a self-improving system that gets better with each iteration.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional AI code generation lacks memory - each session starts fresh, repeating the same mistakes and ignoring project-specific conventions. Human developers spend time correcting the same patterns repeatedly.

## Our Solution: Adaptive AI Development

### Key Principles

1. **Learning Through Corrections**
   - AI commits code with clear attribution
   - Humans review and correct
   - AI analyzes corrections to learn patterns
   - Future implementations apply learned patterns

2. **Adaptive Behavior, Not Rigid Stages**
   - AI adapts based on project state
   - Empty project → Establish patterns
   - Patterns exist → Follow them
   - Corrections made → Refine approach

3. **Manageable Review Chunks**
   - Pattern establishment: ~50-100 lines
   - Feature implementation: ~200-500 lines
   - One feature = One PR = One review cycle

4. **PRP Methodology + Intelligence**
   - Preserves rigor: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
   - Adds learning: Each PRP incorporates past corrections
   - Quality gates ensure production-ready code

## The Workflow

```
1. Human writes high-level concepts
   ↓
2. AI breaks down into implementable features
   ↓
3. AI implements features one at a time
   ↓
4. Human reviews and corrects
   ↓
5. AI learns from corrections
   ↓
6. Next implementation is better
   ↓
   (Repeat until project complete)
```

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Concept Analysis
- Human provides project vision in `.aidev/concept/`
- AI analyzes and creates feature queue
- Features are numbered for execution order
- Pattern establishment tasks created first

### Phase 2: Iterative Development
```bash
/aidev-next-task  # AI picks next feature, implements it
```
- AI checks for existing patterns
- Generates PRP with learned knowledge
- Implements with git commits
- Creates PR for review

### Phase 3: Learning Loop
```bash
/aidev-review-complete --pr=23  # After human corrections
```
- AI analyzes what changed
- Captures patterns with confidence scores
- Updates knowledge base
- Future work applies lessons

## Key Innovations

1. **Git-Based Learning**
   - Every AI commit is attributed
   - Human corrections are tracked
   - Diff analysis reveals patterns
   - Learning persists across sessions

2. **Confidence-Based Pattern Application**
   - Patterns earn confidence through consistency
   - High-confidence patterns (>0.8) always applied
   - Conflicting corrections reduce confidence
   - System self-corrects over time

3. **Natural Task Boundaries**
   - Features define work chunks
   - PRs provide review boundaries
   - No artificial stages or phases
   - Workflow adapts to project needs

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reducing Correction Burden**
   - First feature: Many corrections needed
   - Fifth feature: Fewer corrections
   - Tenth feature: Minimal corrections
   - AI has learned project conventions

2. **Consistent Code Quality**
   - Patterns enforced automatically
   - Quality gates prevent regressions
   - Production-ready from the start
   - No technical debt accumulation

3. **Faster Development Cycles**
   - AI handles implementation details
   - Humans focus on architecture decisions
   - Corrections teach, not just fix
   - Each cycle more efficient than last

## Success Metrics

- **Learning Rate**: Corrections per feature over time
- **Pattern Confidence**: Average confidence levels
- **Retry Success**: Improvement when re-attempting features
- **Development Velocity**: Features completed per day

## Long-Term Vision

This system creates a feedback loop where:
- AI gets smarter with each project
- Patterns become documentation
- New team members learn from AI patterns
- Project conventions self-document
- Development accelerates over time

## Implementation Commands

- `/aidev-generate-project` - Break down project vision
- `/aidev-next-task` - Implement next feature
- `/aidev-review-complete` - Capture learning
- `/aidev-retry-feature` - Re-attempt with learning
- `/aidev-export-patterns` - Document conventions

## Philosophy

> "Don't just correct the code, teach the system."

Each correction is an investment in future productivity. The AI doesn't just execute tasks - it learns how you want things done and applies that knowledge going forward.

This creates a true human-AI partnership where both parties contribute their strengths:
- Humans: Vision, architecture, quality standards
- AI: Implementation, consistency, pattern recognition

Together, they build better software faster.
