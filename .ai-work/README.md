# AI Work Directory

This directory contains AI-generated context and learning data.

## Structure

- `sessions/` - Individual AI work sessions with decisions and context
- `knowledge/` - Accumulated knowledge and patterns
- `patterns/` - Established and learned code patterns
- `corrections/` - Human corrections captured for learning

## Workflow

1. AI reads from `knowledge/` and `patterns/` at start of each session
2. AI documents decisions in `sessions/`
3. Human corrections are captured in `corrections/`
4. Patterns are updated based on corrections
